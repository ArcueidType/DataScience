## Week 1 practices:

### Practice 1:

This repository is the result

### Practice 2:
result:

![Hello](/week1/img/hello.png)

upload:

![Uploading](/week1/img/upload.png)

![Upload Result](/week1/img/uploadresult.png)

### Practice 3:

Result after modified:

![info](/week1/img/info.png)

Use

`git add [file]`

`git commit -m "[message]"` 

`git push [repo] [local branch]:[remote branch]`

to upload or update repo

Repo after update(with message "print sth new"):

![repo updated](/week1/img/update.png)

### Practice 4:

Result:
![prac4](/week1/img/prac4.png)

### Practice 5:

Result:

![prac5](/week1/img/prac5.png)

### Practice 6:

Result:

![prac6](/week1/img/prac6.png)

### Practice 7:

Result:

![prac7](/week1/img/prac7.png)

### Practice 8:

Result:

![prac8](/week1/img/prac8.png)

### Practice 9:

Result:

![prac9](/week1/img/prac9.png)

### Practice 10:

Result:

![prac10](/week1/img/prac10.png)

### Practice 11:

Result:

![prac11](/week1/img/prac11.png)

### Practice 12:

There are 2 ways of implementation

One is simply use `** (1/3)`(can this be called an algorithm?)

Another is based on Newton Iteration to estimate the root
